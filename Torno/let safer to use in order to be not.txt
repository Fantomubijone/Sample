let safer to use in order to be not overide the variable
_ and $ pwede pero not recommended suggested is to use 


var year; the data type would be undefined
unless placed a value where the computer automatically assign
decimal - double
whole - integer


declaring  variables is better if declared by its own line becuase it is hard to find
var year;
var month:

vs 

var year, month;

both string but difference
'Hello' - wysiwyg
"Hello" - uses an escape code


Lifetime of variable
var - will depends on your web
let - after the function is called
